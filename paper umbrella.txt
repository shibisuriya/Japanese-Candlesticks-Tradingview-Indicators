//This script marks all the paper umbrella candle sticks present on the chart.
//Note: This script has no awareness of the peaks and troughs, a paper umbrella appearing near a peak is called a hanging man
//      and it is considered as a bearish pattern whereas a paper umbrella appearing near a trough is called a hammer and it is 
//      considered as a bullish pattern. This script marks all the paper umbrella(s) present on the chart irrepective of their
//      position. 
//Note: The color of the paper umbrella has very little significance.
