# Trading view indicators to spot Japanese candlesticks 
This repository contains a collection of Tradingview indicators
implemented in pinescript to spot Japanese candlesticks pattern in Tradingview charts.
I have learned Japanese candlestick patterns from the book **Japanese candlesticks charting techniques** written by **Steve Nison**, I then used the mathematical concept of **ratios and proportions**, **pinescript** and **OHLC** data of the candles to spot candlestick patterns in Tradingview charts. I have written the description given by Steve Nison about the candlestick pattern at the beginning of each candlestick pattern's file using the pinescript comments. To use these indicators open a full featured Tradingview chart, paste the script in the Pine Editor and press the Add to Chart button.
