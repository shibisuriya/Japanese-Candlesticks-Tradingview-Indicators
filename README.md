# Trading view indicators to spot Japanese candlesticks 
This repository contains a collection of tradingview indicators
implemented in pinescript to spot Japanese candlesticks.
I have used description given by Steve Nison about candlesticks in his infamous book Japanese candlesticks charting techniques to
mathematical quantify OHLC data and spot the appropriate candlesticks pattern.
I have written the descriptions given by Steve Nison
about the candlestick patterns at the beginning of each candlestick pattern's file using the pinescript comments.
To use these indicators open a full featured tradingview chart, paste the script in the Pine Editor and press the Add to Chart button.
