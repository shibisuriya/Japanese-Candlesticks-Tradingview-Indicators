# Tradingview indicators to spot Japanese candlesticks

This repository contains a collection of Tradingview indicators implemented using pinescript to spot Japanese candlesticks pattern in Tradingview charts.

I have learned Japanese candlestick patterns from **[Zerodha Varsity's Technical Analysis module](https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/)** written by **Mr. Karthik Rangappa**, I used the description provided for each pattern in the material and  mathematically quantified the OHLC data of the candles using the mathematical concept of ratios and proportions to spot candlestick patterns in **Tradingview full featured charts**.

I have written the description provided in the material about each candlestick pattern at the beginning of the candlestick pattern's source file using pinescript comments.

## How to use?

To use these indicators, open a full featured Tradingview chart, paste the script in the Pine Editor, and press the Add to Chart button.
